# Coding Style

- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules, path aliases (`@/*`, `@types`)
- **Format**: Prettier (2 spaces, single quotes, no semicolons, 100-char width)
- **Naming**:
  - PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables, kebab-case for directories
  - Component names should include feature prefix (e.g., `GeneratorImageRenderer`, `GeneratorImageDownloadButton` for generator feature)
- **Commits**: Conventional format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`)
- **Comments**: Write what code does, not why or how. Keep short and action-focused. Use `// Step N: <action>` for workflows. Avoid redundant explanations.
- **Simplicity**:
  - Prefer existing simple variables over nested property access (e.g., use `model_id` instead of `modelDetails?.id` when both are available)
  - Only render components when relevant to current state
  - Use direct function references instead of arrow functions when no arguments are needed (e.g., `onPress={openModal}` instead of `onPress={() => openModal()}`)
- **Modular design**:
  - Break down components and functions into smaller, reusable pieces
  - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
  - Extract presentation logic into separate components (e.g., separate renderer and button components)
  - Container components should orchestrate, presentational components should render
- **Research first**: Check official documentation and existing patterns before implementing new features or using unfamiliar APIs.
- **Type safety**:
  - Never use `any` type. Use proper types, `unknown`, or type assertions (`as Type`) instead
  - Use built-in utility types where appropriate (e.g., `VoidFunction` instead of `() => void`)
- **Testing**: Always run tests after refactoring to ensure behavior is preserved
- **State Management**:
  - Use Zustand stores for shared state that needs to be accessed across components
  - Centralize UI state (modal open/close, tab selection) in stores when multiple components need to control it
  - Use local state (`useState`) for component-specific state that doesn't need to be shared
  - When storing UI state in Zustand, use `partialize` to exclude it from persistence (only persist user preferences)
