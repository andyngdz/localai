**Ask clarifying questions before proposing solutions. Never make assumptions about user intent.**

- Use `AskUserQuestion` tool for ambiguous requests ("optimize this", "fix the error", "improve performance")
- Get full context before implementing complex features (authentication, APIs, new architectures)
- **Don't ask** for trivial commands (running tests, formatting, reading files)
- Present options as selectable choices when multiple approaches exist
